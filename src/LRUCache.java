/**
 * 
 * #146 /lru-cache/
 * 
 * Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It
 * should support the following operations: get and put.
 * 
 * get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key
 * exists in the cache, otherwise return -1. put(key, value) - Set or insert the
 * value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity,
 * it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new
 * item.
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity? Example:
 * LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 capacity );
 * 
 *
